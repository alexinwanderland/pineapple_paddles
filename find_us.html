<h2 class="valledofas">our shop</h2>
<p>We are located inside Coco for Coconuts Cafe on the beachfront in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. Our exact address is on Paseo del Rey between Calle El Rio Escondido and Avenida El Pargo, but don't worry, it's a small beach -- you'll find us.

Here you'll find our retail shop, rentals, and the meeting point for our classes and lessons.</p>
