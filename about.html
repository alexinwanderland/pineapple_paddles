  <h3 class="valledofas">about us</h3>
    <p>Laughing Lotus was voted the most eclectic yoga studio in all of New York city—and now it’s making its way to New Orleans. With many mat-to-mat classes hosted in their Manhattan, Williamsburg and San Francisco studios, an expansion was unavoidable.

    While the location was surprising (because the city isn’t exactly a fitness mecca) the partnership makes perfect sense for anyone who’s ever listened to the harmonium at Laughing Lotus or participated in a second line in New Orleans.</p>
